This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard the personal information you provide when you visit or interact with our website (the "Site") <a href="http://www.accuratebiomedicals.com">www.accuratebiomedicals.com</a></p>

        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Notice. The notice can be easily accessible via a link at the bottom of each web page.</p>

        <h2>What personal information does ACCURATE Biomedicals collect and why?</h2>
        <p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual that can directly or indirectly identify that individual. It does not include data from which identifying information has been removed (anonymous data).</p>

        <p><strong>ACCURATE Biomedicals does not knowingly collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal data relating to children.</li>
            <li>Special categories of personal data (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data).</li>
            <li>Information about criminal convictions and offences.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In general, we will use your personal information only for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice or for purposes that we explain to you at the time we collect your personal information. We may also process your personal information for additional purposes that are compatible with that original purpose if, and where, this is permitted by applicable data protection laws.</p>

        <h2>Information that you Provide to us</h2>
        <p>You may provide us with your personal information (such as your name, contact details, email address, employer details and job title) in several ways: by contacting our customer service teams, registering for an event, entering a competition, providing feedback on the quality of any products or services, or when accessing information on our website. You could provide this information in writing via email, inquiry forms, social media or by post; manually on forms at events, meetings or conferences; using our website; or orally, either face to face, or over the telephone.</p>

        <h2>How will we use your information?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To respond to inquiries and provide customer support.</li>
            <li>Perform any contract with you (for example take payment and deliver the products you have ordered).</li>
            <li>Provide you with information about goods and services we offer that are similar to those that you have purchased, enquired about, or shown an interest in.</li>
            <li>Provide you with information about goods and services we believe would be of interest to you.</li>
            <li>To send administrative and marketing communications, where permitted by law.</li>
            <li>To improve and personalize your experience on our Site.</li>
            <li>Notify you about changes to our service.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p>

        <p>Save for information required as part of a contract we have entered into with you, generally speaking, you are not obligated to provide us with this data (by statute, contract or otherwise), however, a failure to provide this may mean we are unable to provide you with the services or information you require.</p>

        <h2>Information that we collect automatically</h2>
        <p>When you visit our website, we use cookies, which are small text files on your computer that allows our website to recognize you as a user. For example, the information provided by a cookie may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information about any device you have used to access our website, for example: your device's make and model, browser, internet protocol (IP) address internet service provider (ISP) and your broad geographic location.</li>
            <li>How you use our website; for example: how your device has interacted with our website, including the pages accessed and links clicked, websites visited before or after our website, products viewed or searched for and the length of visits to certain pages.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Collecting this information helps us ensure that the website is presented in the most effective manner for you. It also enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our website, where they come from, what information on our website is of interest to them and to send them marketing messages and advertising related to their interest. For further information about cookies, please see our Cookie Notice below.</p>

        <p>We also collect data concerning whether any email communication you have received from us have been opened and if you have clicked on any links within the email. This helps us ensure our communications are useful for you.</p>

        <p>The provision of this information is not a statutory or contractual requirement; however, this information is collected automatically when you access our website and you are obligated to provide this when accessing our site. You can, however, block cookies as set out in our Cookie Notice. Preventing cookies may impact the functioning of our website.</p>

        <h2>Information that we obtain from third party sources</h2>
        <p>From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third parties (for example from conferences, tradeshows or life science networking organisations), but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.</p>

        <p>We may also collect information about you from publicly available sources, including from scientific publications, university websites and publicly available information on social media.</p>

        <p>The types of personal information we may collect in this way include your name, your job title, the institution or company you represent, your email addresses, telephone number and your research interests. We may also collect your language preference. This is not usually provided via a statutory or contractual obligation but it is in our legitimate interests to obtain this information. If this data is not provided we may be unable to contact you with information that we think may be of interest to you.</p>

        <p>We will combine this information with the information you provide to us and information we automatically collect about you to maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you. We will also use the combined information about you to form a view on what products we think you, or others similar to you, may want or need to target our marketing closer to your interests.</p>

        <p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information or purchased products from us, provided us with your details when you contacted our customer service teams, entered a competition, registered for a promotion, or accessed information from our website and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving marketing communications.</p>

        <h2>Who does ACCURATE Biomedicals share my personal information with?</h2>
        <p>We do not, and will not, sell your personal data to a third party.</p>

        <p>Internally, we will share your data with employees of ours (including our Commercial and Finance teams) to the extent necessary for them to fulfil their roles and/or in line with business needs.</p>

        <p>We will also share your data externally with certain recipients as an essential part of being able to provide you with products and services, to run our events, and to enable us to run our business effectively. Such recipients include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trusted Third Party Service Providers and Partners:</strong> Those who help us to run our business (for example, companies that provide support for our website and internal IT systems); or those who help us to get our products to you (for example, a courier company that delivers the products you have ordered or a distributor who operates in a country that we do not sell to directly). We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Our Group Companies:</strong> As sometimes our affiliates are responsible for different activities that are relevant to our relationship with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Any Competent Law Enforcement Body, Regulatory, Government Agency, Court or Other Third Party:</strong> Where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) As a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) To exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) To protect your vital interests or those of any other person.</li>
            <li><strong>A Potential Buyer:</strong> (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must treat this information confidentially and only for the purpose of assessing their obligations, rights and responsibilities on the sale of the business.</li>
            <li><strong>To any Other Person:</strong> Where you have given your consent to the disclosure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third party links on ACCURATE Biomedical's website</h2>
        <p>Our website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit.</p>

        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>ACCURATE Biomedicals will not hold your personal information for any longer than is necessary. We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>

        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <h2>Data protection rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You have a right to be informed about how we process your personal information - ACCURATE Biomedicals does this by way of this Privacy Notice.</li>
            <li>If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the "Contact us" heading below.</li>
            <li>You may be able to object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the "Contact us" heading below.</li>
            <li>You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.</li>
            <li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not stop processing of your personal information if it is necessary for performing a contract with you, or if such processing is in ACCURATE Biomedicals legitimate interests. Further, the withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
            <li>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to remediate any issues you identify, so please do contact us in the first instance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. You will not have to pay a fee to exercise your data protection rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee or we may refuse to comply with your request if it is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.</p>

        <p>Please note we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise your data protection rights. This is a security measure to ensure that your personal data is not disclosed to any person who does not have a right to receive it.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We keep this Privacy Policy under regular review and may update it from time to time. If we make any changes, we will take appropriate measures to inform you or to obtain your consent, if and where this is required by applicable data protection laws.</p>
